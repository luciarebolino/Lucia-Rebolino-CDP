WHO ARE YOU

The uncertain future of architecture practice is a fuzzy element. 
A system of numbers that incorporates the unknown. 
Myopic about what will happen tomorrow, we stretch our boundaries, redefining what is possible. We are microscopic and macroscopic at the intersection of different scales, we are versatile, we adapt, we transform. 
Experimenting and using Design as a critical tool is the path that I, as an architect, want to follow and pursue. 

As a designer, how can I push my knowledge into a not conventional Academia, building in the digital and physical space new design research models?

In a time of crisis, climatic and social, as human beings, we are called to act, to reinvent ourselves, and as Architects to transform our approach and the world we live in. 
This is the future I imagine myself to undertake.
